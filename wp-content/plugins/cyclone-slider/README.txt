== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why is my slider not working? =
Check for javascript errors in your page. This is the most common cause of the slider not running.
`cycle not a function` error - most probably you have double jquery (jquery.js) included from improperly coded plugins. Remove the duplicate jquery or deactivate the plugin causing the double jquery include.

= Why is there is an extra slide that I didn't add? = 
Most probably its wordpress adding paragpraphs on line breaks next to the slides therefore adding a blank `<p>` slide. You can try adding this to functions.php:
`remove_filter('the_content', 'wpautop');`

= How to display it in post/page? =
Use the shortcode `[cycloneslider id ="my-slideshow"]`

= How to display it inside template files (header.php, index.php, page.php, etc.)? =
Use `<?php echo do_shortcode('[cycloneslider id ="my-slideshow"]'); ?>`

= What are the shortcode options? =
`[cycloneslider id ="my-slideshow" fx="fade" timeout="5000" speed="1000" width="500" height="300" show_prev_next="true" show_nav="true"]`

= How can I use templates? =
`[cycloneslider id ="my-slideshow" template="custom-name"]` 

= Where do I add my own templates? =
Inside your theme create a folder named "cycloneslider" (as of version 1.0.5). Add your templates inside.
