	OVERVIEW (since 4.0.2.1-4.1):
		This update focuses primarily on the Remote Destinations system with major feature additions, enhancements, and bug fixes to it.
		Remote Destination performance accross all destinations has improved, as well as robustness and adding various features such as transfer speed tracking for most destinations.
		Dropbox destination added for users of PHP v5.3 or newer with _significant_ improvements including but not limited to: No more 150mb API limit, significant memory usage reduction, and multipart chunked sends for breaking up large files.
		sFTP (beta) destination added. Please provide feedback of success or any problems encountered during beta stage.
	Menu icon now has retina support for high resolution version.
	File restoration temp directory cleanup is now part of periodic cleanup function.
	ImportBuddy: cpanel database creation verifies valid characters are used.
	New remote destination additions are now confirmed on next page as inline alert rather than popup javascript alert box.
	Fixed update link showing minor version available on Server Info page even if on latest minor version.
	Fixed "Recent Backups" page listing backups out of proper chronological order for some.
	periodic_cleanup() now has a minimum age limit before orphaned fileoptions files will be purged. This helps keep Recent Backups page properly populated.
	Deleting a backup via backups_list()'s form no longer immediately deletes its fileoptions file. The cleanup function is now handling all purging of this.
	Removed call to undefined function on Error #4455484589.
	Updated zipbuddy library regarding file_exists() issue.
	Fixed issue where Recent Backups page may not always show all backups.
	FEATURE:
		New Dropbox destination available for users of PHP 5.3 or newer with much improved performance. Only displayed to users with PHP 5.3 or newer.
		Improved performance and large file support.
		Supports multipart chunking to increase file sizes able to be transferred to Dropbox.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		Added new "View Log" link on Remote Destinations "Recent Transfer Status" tab. Ability to view log details specific to a certain send. Useful for troubleshooting.
	ENHANCEMENT:
		Write speed information now available under "Transfer Information" column in Recent Remote Destinations send list for most destinations.
	Remote destination sends now stored within individual fileoptions files prefixed with "send-" to prevent race conditions when multiple destination sends active simultaneously (ie due to chunking).
	Misc minor destination bug fixes.
	Misc improvement to logging for troubleshooting remote sends.
	Updated Sucuri plan URL.
	Many misc destination improvements behind the scenes.
	ImportBuddy option to ignore existing WordPress tables now only warns rather than blocking proceeding.
	S3 instantiation now casting SSL parameter to bool to insure proper passing.
	FEATURE:
		Amazon S3 destination updated to new version with support for chunked multipart file transfers for handling larger files.
		All files transferred to S3 are now automatically encrypted with AES256 encryption on destination server.
	Rackspace destination now masks API key in edit mode.
	Fixed file viewer temporary files not being cleaned up after viewing.
	Fixed "Extract File with Extraction Failure Does Not Clean Up the Backup Specific Temporary Directory".

	When full error logging is enabled, backup error notification emails will include the log file for the backup as an attachment.
	ImportBuddy: Fixed tooltip being hidden in popup windows due to z-index issue.
	UI lib call for alert function now pre-initialized pb_backupbuddy::$ui in case it is not yet initialized.
	Reversed order of history.txt so that newest updates are now at the top.
	Updated ZipBuddy library to now support extracting individual files via ZipArchive and Pclzip as fallbacks (in that order). - Jeremy
	Fixed issue where Stash chunking could prevent backup limiting from ocurring.
	Added additional check prior to sending to Stash to verify authentication credentials are valid to avoid error cascade.
	Updated ZipBuddy library files to use pre-built test ZIP file.
	Amazon S3: Prior to each chunked send any existing multipart transfers stalled will be aborted with S3 if they exceed cerain age to free up resources in S3 account.
	Amazon S3: Periodic BackupBuddy housekeeping function will look for and cleanup and multipart chunk transfers (for destinations having chunking enabled). This will cleanup backups that stalled by checking they exceed a certain age (72hrs currently).
	PHP database dump now logs which table it is about to dump.
	PHP database dump now logs last query attempted on fatal failure (eg. on error mysql server went away).
	Added additional check for existance of profile index when setting up profile for manually triggered backup.
	Disabled spawn_cron() call for manual backups. Prevents very odd race condition where an additional spawned process could run concurrently -- but ONLY immediately after the database dump. This may have been the cause of some servers' cron failing to schedule immediately after the Database dump step.
	Updated Windows ZIP executable ZIP file to include newer zip versions at a new URL: http://ithemes.com/backupbuddy_files/backupbuddy_windows_unzip.zip
	Updated file_tree() function to handle missing wp-content and other edge cases. Sorts directories first. - Jeremy
